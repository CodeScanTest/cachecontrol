# HTTP Headers


This is a stand alone Scala library that parses HTTP headers according to [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231) using the Scala Parser Combinator library.  It is designed to have minimal dependencies and maximum text coverage, so multiple projects can use this without getting involved.
